#Final Project

Emilio Segura: On the Almacenes (2).csv which is a data base that shows the 30 stores along with the main distribution center what we did was clean the information firstly by making sure that the stores where just shown once in data base, each store could have multiple locations depending on the status of the product. So what we did afterwards was split the string which looked like this [8, 'WCENT/Existencias'] and dividing it in the 2 different columns that we need , firstly the number which is the id of my location which will help us connect to the other data bases in the course of the proyect and then the name of that location so we could identify them in a more easy way.
