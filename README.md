## Description of the Data
### productos.csv file
This is the main database, in which we will base and connect the other databases. This is a database with all the products and categories that we want to model. With it we will filter the information we want from the other databases. The objective was to clean it, obtain just the categories that are meaningful to obtain and optimal inventory, and finnaly to drop duplicates. In this database we filtered all the categories to just have 'DISPOSITIVO / CELULAR / LIBRE' and 'DISPOSITIVO / CELULAR / TELCEL', so we just have those to start making our models.
